# NeuroMath
A neural network for predicting numerical sequences 

## Overview 
This project implements a variant of neural recurrent network of lstm type, which predicts the next number of some numerical sequence. Now there is a choice of
* sequence of 0 and 1
* sequence of the remainder of division by 10
* arithmetic progression 
* Fibonacci series 
* a power series on the basis of 2.

## How to build and execute
First of all, you must install tensorflow and numpy packages (more information in file used_packages)
After that, you can run example in plotter.py
``` shell
python plotter.py
```
